I initially wrote this code as part of an interview process and when I discussed the feedback on it, it was mentioned that my methods were too long and I was reminded of the old dusty book on my shelf called 'Clean Code'...

Re reading the book has reminded me of the basics of clean coding that I'd forgotten over the years since first reading it and I could easily see where I'd gone wrong!

So I'm having a play on tidying up what was an 'okay' working program and making it into a cleaner version of itself.

There are other elements of the code that I feel I could do better, such as iterating twice over the saved commands collections to calculate the final result at print time - I feel that's a bit clunky and could be done in a more efficient way.
